 * the 'About' and 'TopProducts' components. This layout structure is typically used in a React application
 * to organize sections of the application that might be part of a larger page or layout. The 'About'
 * component provides information about the application or business, while 'TopProducts' displays
 * a list of highlighted products.
 *
 * This component is usually used in the main part of the page layout where primary content is displayed.
